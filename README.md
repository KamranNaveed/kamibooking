This app was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and allows users to search for and book hotels. Features included are:

🛡 Admin login: Admins can log in to the app and add new hotels to the database.

🔎 Hotel search: Users can search for hotels based on the number of people, desired price range, and available dates. The search results are generated by querying the database for available hotels.

🏩 Hotel pages: Each hotel has its own page where users can view more information about the hotel, including its features and amenities.

🛌 Booking: Once a user has found a suitable hotel, they can proceed to book it by providing their personal and payment information.
